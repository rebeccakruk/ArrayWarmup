WARMUP:

1. Create a folder called ArrayWarmup and connect to Git/GitHub
2. Create an index.html and app.js, link them together
3. Configure your debugger
4. Create a variable student_name and give it a value (string)
5. Create a variable student_gpa and give it a value (number between 0.0 and 4.0)
6. Create a variable honor_role and give it a value (boolean)
7. Create an if statement that will print a nice message if the student is on the honor role
8. Add an else statement that will print an encouraging message otherwise

9. Create an if, else-if, else block that achieves the following:
  9.1. Print F to the console if the gpa is between 0-1.9
  9.2. Print D to the console if the gpa is between 2.0-2.4
  9.3. Print C to the console if the gpa is between 2.5-2.9
  9.4. Print B to the console if the gpa is between 3.0-3.4
  9.5. Print A to the console if the gpa is between 3.5-4.0

10. Create an array called student_names and give it 3 values (strings)
11. Create an array called student_gpas and give it 3 values (numbers)
12. Create an array called honor_roles and give it 3 values (booleans)

13. Create an if statement that will print a nice message if ALL students are on the honor role
14. Add an else-if statement that will print a somewhat-nice message if ANY 2 / 3 students are on the honor role
15. Add an else statement that will print a motivational message otherwise

16. Use the push function to add a new student name, gpa and honor role status.
17. Create a variable called last_student and assign it the value using the pop function of student_names
18. Create a variable called last_student_gpa and assign it the value using the pop function of student_gpas
19. Create a variable called last_student_honor and assign it the value using the pop function of honor_roles

20. Create an if statement that will print the message "Last Student Best Student" if the gpa of the last student is greater than all other students
